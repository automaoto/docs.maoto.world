# Setting Up Your Environment

Before installing `maoto-agent`, it's recommended to set up a virtual environment. This helps isolate your project dependencies and avoid conflicts.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a Virtual Environment">
        Choose your preferred method to create a virtual environment:

        **Using venv (Python's built-in tool):**
        ```shell Terminal
        python3 -m venv .venv
        ```

        **Using conda:**
        ```shell Terminal
        conda create -n maoto-env python=3.12
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Activate the Virtual Environment">
        Activate your virtual environment based on your platform:

        **On macOS/Linux (venv):**
        ```shell Terminal
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

        **On Windows (venv):**
        ```shell Terminal
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

        **Using conda (all platforms):**
        ```shell Terminal
        conda activate maoto-env
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

# Installing MAOTO

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install `maoto-agent`">
        Install MAOTO Agent package:
        ```shell Terminal
        pip install maoto-agent
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Upgrade `maoto-agent` (Existing Installations Only)">
        If you have an older version of `maoto-agent` installed, you can upgrade it:
        ```shell Terminal
        pip install --upgrade maoto-agent
        ```

        <Note>
            Skip this step if you're doing a fresh installation.
        </Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Verify Installation">
        Check your installed versions:
        ```shell Terminal
        pip freeze | grep maoto-agent
        ```

        You should see something like:
        ```markdown Output
        maoto-agent==X.X.X
        ```
        <Check>Installation successful! You're ready to create your first MAOTO Agent.</Check>
