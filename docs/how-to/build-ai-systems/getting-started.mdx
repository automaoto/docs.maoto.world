## Introduction

Before diving into the specifics of building AI systems, it is essential to understand the foundational concepts and principles that underpin the development of AI Agents.
here is a possible structure to follow:

### Configure the AI System

1. **Plan the AI system:**
    - Decide what task it will do
    - any external APIs needed

2. **Define actions and handlers:**
    - similar to quickstart but perhaps with multiple actions or complex logic.
    - how will the system bid for tasks?

3. **Integrate External Services:**
    - if the system will call third-party APIs, how to do that safely?

### Test in the Target Environment

Locally, on a test server, or in a cloud environment, test the AI system to ensure it works as expected.

### Deploying the System

Once tested and  the AI system is ready, deploy it to the target environment. This could be a cloud server, a mobile app, or a web application.
