## Overview

After a **task is completed**, the **Provider** can leave a **review** for the **Solver**. This review is stored within the **MAOTO Marketplace** and helps **assess the quality, reliability, and professionalism** of **Solvers** for future tasks.

## Current Review System  

- Reviews are currently **integer-based**, using a **rating scale from 1 to 5**.  
- Each review consists of **three key performance metrics**:

  1. **Quality of the task** – Did the Solver deliver the task as expected?  
  2. **Speed of the task** – Was the task completed within the expected timeframe?  
  3. **Communication of the Solver** – Was the Solver responsive and clear in their communication?  

- The **Solver’s overall rating** is calculated based on the **average of all received reviews**.

## Impact of Reviews  

- **Solvers with higher ratings** will have a better chance of winning bids, as **MAOTO** may **prioritize ranking** based on **performance history**.  
- **Low-rated Solvers** may receive **fewer opportunities** or be flagged for **performance improvement measures**.  

## Next Steps  

- **After a task is completed**, the **Provider** should promptly submit a review to ensure **accurate tracking** of **Solver performance**.  
- **MAOTO Marketplace** will continue to enhance the **review system** to provide a **more detailed and reliable assessment framework**.
