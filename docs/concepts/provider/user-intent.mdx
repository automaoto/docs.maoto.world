## Overview  

The **Provider User Intent** defines the **goal and expectations** behind a task initiated by a user. However, **how to formally specify user intent** is still **undefined**, as **MAOTO currently only supports**:

1. **Task Description** – A human-readable summary of what needs to be done.  
2. **Task Context** – A structured **JSON object** that provides additional metadata.  

## Considerations for Constructing a User Intent  

When defining **user intent**, it is important to consider:  

### **1. Measurable Outcomes**  
- Every task should have a **clear success criterion**.  
- This could be:
  - **Verified through a third party** (currently not supported).  
  - **Confirmed by the user** after task execution.  
- A well-defined outcome ensures **Resolvers** understand **when a task is completed** and reduces disputes.  

### **2. Personalization through Context**  
- The **task context** is a powerful tool to **describe the user and their preferences**.  
- **Providers** should use **context** to:
  - Store user-specific preferences (e.g., preferred file formats, notification settings).  
  - Provide important **background information** that affects task execution.  
  - Pass along **historical data** that could refine how a **Resolver** handles the request.  

### **3. Task Completeness**  
- **A well-defined task** minimizes unnecessary back-and-forth, reducing:  
  - **Time wastage** due to missing parameters.  
  - **Unnecessary compute costs** from redundant Resolver requests.  
- Some parameters are easy to **predict and define upfront**.  
- Others **may inherently require follow-ups** from the **Resolver**.  
  - In such cases, **Resolvers** can submit an **Information Request** to obtain missing details.  
  
For now, **Providers** should ensure **tasks are as clearly defined as possible** to **improve efficiency and task execution**.
