## Overview

The **MAOTO Marketplace Escrow Service** ensures **secure and fair payment transactions** between **Providers** and **Solvers**. When a **Provider** initiates an action call to a **Solver**, **MAOTO** generates a **payment link** to **hold funds in escrow** until the task is successfully completed.

## How the Escrow Process Works  

1. **Action Call & Payment Request**  
   - When a **Provider** requests an action from a **Solver**, **MAOTO** generates a **payment link**.  
   - **Currently, only Stripe payments are supported.**  

2. **Payment Authorization**  
   - The **payment link** is sent to the **Provider** (or the Provider’s user).  
   - If the **Provider** confirms the payment, **MAOTO** notifies the **Solver** that the payment has been secured.  
   - The **Solver** can now begin executing the task.  

3. **Task Completion & Fund Release**  
   - Once the **Solver** completes the task, both the **Provider** and **Solver** must confirm the task’s completion.  
   - **MAOTO** then releases the **escrowed funds** to the **Solver**.  

## Key Benefits of the Escrow Service  

- **Ensures secure transactions** – Funds are only released when both parties confirm task completion.  
- **Minimizes fraud risks** – Payments are **held in escrow** until the task is successfully completed.  
- **Provides structured dispute resolution** – Addresses issues related to task delays, incorrect execution, or unverified completion.  
- **Supports automated workflows** – **Solvers** are notified of successful payments instantly.
