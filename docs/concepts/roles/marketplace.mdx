## Task Lifecycle in the MAOTO Marketplace

1. **Task Posting**  
   - A **Provider** posts a task with all relevant details.

   - MAOTO ranks bids based on multiple factors:
     - Price competitiveness  
     - Speed of completion  
     - Historical reliability  

4. **Bid Selection & Payment**  
   - The **Provider** selects the most suitable bid.  
   - The **Provider** pays the bid amount to MAOTO. Which acts as an escrow. 

5. **Task Execution**  
   - The winning **Resolver** is notified.  
   - The **Resolver** completes the assigned task.

6. **Payment Release & Review**  
   - Upon successful task completion, MAOTO releases funds to the **Resolver**.
