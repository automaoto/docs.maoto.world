## Overview

During the task resolution process, a **Solver** may require additional details from the **Provider** to successfully complete a task. The **Solver Information Request** mechanism allows Solvers to request **missing parameters or clarifications** before proceeding with a bid or task execution.

## Information Request Process

1. **Initial Task Evaluation**  
   - The **Solver** receives a task listing with a predefined set of parameters.  
   - If all required details are available, the **Solver** proceeds with bidding or execution.  

2. **Determining Missing Information**  
   - If critical information is missing, the **Solver** identifies what additional data is required.  
   - Missing information could include:
     - **Specific task constraints** (e.g., delivery format, exact deadline).  
     - **Contextual details** (e.g., target website for a web scraper, required dataset for analysis).  
     - **User preferences** (e.g., prioritizing speed over cost).  

3. **Submitting an Information Request**  
   - The **Solver** sends a structured request to the **Provider**, specifying:
     - The **exact missing parameters** needed.  
     - A brief explanation of why the data is required.  
   - The **Provider** receives the request and evaluates whether to fulfill it.  

4. **Provider Response**  
   - The **Provider** can either:
     - **Fulfill the request** by supplying the missing details.  
     - **Decline the request** based on user preferences or task scope.  

5. **Task Progression Based on Response**  
   - If the **Provider** supplies the required information:
     - The **Solver** updates its parameters and proceeds with bidding or task execution.  
   - If the request is denied:
     - The **Solver** can either proceed with available data or **decline to bid on the task**.

## Example Scenario: Ride Hailer Solver  

- A **ride-hailing Solver** receives a task with:
  - **Pickup location:** Provided  
  - **Destination:** Missing  
- The Solver initiates an **Information Request** to obtain the missing **destination** before placing a bid.  
- The **Provider** supplies the required location details, enabling the Solver to calculate the price and submit an accurate bid.  

## Key Considerations

- **Efficiency in Matchmaking:**  
  - Solvers should aim to request only essential missing information to prevent unnecessary delays.  
  - Providers can use **predefined templates** to standardize response formats.  

- **Impact on Bidding Process:**  
  - The faster a **Solver** resolves missing data, the more competitive it becomes in **MAOTOâ€™s bid ranking system**.  
  - If a task remains ambiguous after an information request is denied, the Solver should **carefully evaluate risk** before proceeding.
