## Overview

When building a **Resolver**, you can register **actions** to the **MAOTO Marketplace**. These actions define specific capabilities that a **Resolver** can execute when handling tasks. 

## Required Parameters for an Action

Each **action** must include the following attributes:

1. **name**
   - The name of the action. (TODO: must be unique?) 
   
2. **parameters**  
   - Defines the input parameters required for the action to be executed.  
   - If required parameters are missing, the **Resolver** can initiate an [Information Request](./information-request) to request additional details from the **Provider**.

3. **description**  
   - A clear explanation of what the action does.  

4. **tags**  
   - Keywords used by **MAOTO** to shortlist actions with relevant tasks. More information on tags can be found in the [Subscription](../marketplace/subscription) documentation.

5. **cost**
   - The estimated cost to execute the action.  

## Dynamic Parameters & Cost Adjustments

All **action parameters** can be dynamically set by the **Resolver**, making them adaptable to the task at hand.

### **Cost Dynamics**
The cost of an action is **not fixed** and can be adjusted based on multiple factors:
- **Task complexity** – More complex tasks may require additional computation or processing.  
- **Execution time** – Longer tasks may have higher costs.  
- **Resource utilization** – If an action requires external API calls, processing power, or paid services, costs may increase.  

### **Example: Ride Hailer Resolver**
In a **ride-hailing** scenario, the cost of an action (e.g., booking a ride) is highly **case-specific**.  
- Factors such as **distance, traffic conditions, surge pricing**, and **availability of drivers** dynamically affect the cost.  
- The **Resolver** adapts pricing in real-time before placing a bid.  
- Different **ride-hailing providers** (e.g., Uber, Lyft, etc.) may have **different pricing structures**, which the **Resolver** can factor in before setting its final bid.

#### **Scenario: Price Variation Based on External Factors**
For instance, the **price of a ride from Point A to Point B** may vary due to:
- **Time of day** – Peak hours may lead to surge pricing.  
- **Traffic conditions** – Higher congestion can increase trip time and costs.  
- **Availability of drivers** – Fewer drivers lead to higher demand-based pricing.  

The **Resolver** can analyze these variables and dynamically adjust **the bid price** to ensure competitiveness and profit.
